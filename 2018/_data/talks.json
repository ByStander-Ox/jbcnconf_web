      "abstract": "In this workshop the attendees will take six different problems, explore solution to them using the functional capabilities in the Java language. The presenter will, along the way, assist the participants, and also discuss the solutions. The objective of this workshop is to motivate developers to think more functionally, reduce code complexity, and to make better use of more recent features in the language. Attendees are expected to have Java 9 installed on their machine along with their favorite IDEs.",
