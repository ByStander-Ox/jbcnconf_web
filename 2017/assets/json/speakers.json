But this doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and we're left with a vague sensation that the next version might not be that interesting. Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes to make development a bit nicer.  These features can't be lumped under an umbrella term like Java 8's lambdas and streams, the changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use. In this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding:<br> - How we can use the new Flow API to utilise Reactive Programming <br> - How the improvements to the Streams API make it easier to control real-time streaming data <br> - How to the Collections convenience methods simplify code<br> Along the way we'll bump into other Java 9 features, including some of the additions to interfaces and changes to deprecation.  We’ll see that once you start using Java 9, you can't go back to Before.",

By providing a global overview of the reactive landscape, this session also provides to the attendees a general understanding of the 'reactive' trend, and why it matters. The presentation uses several live coding demos to explain the different concepts. It uses Eclipse Vert.x as a playground to explain how all these concepts work together. Eclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to build reactive and distributed systems on the JVM.

How functional is Java 8 really and is Optional the life saver some people promised it to be?",

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is Go. His big passions are DevOps, Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences. He published The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices, The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters and the Test-Driven Java Development. He is currently working on his third book The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm His random thoughts and tutorials can be found in his blog TechnologyConversations.com.",

        "abstract": "DevOps is as much a cultural as technological change. While it united diverse teams and professionals and thought us how to automate all repetitive steps in our processes, it failed to introduce a real difference in the software landscape we use. Hence, DevOps 2.0 emerged with a drastic change in our methods, tools, and architecture. Finally, we have everything we need to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and self-healing systems delivered to production through continuous deployment. This talk focuses on architectural changes and new tools we should adopt to be able to tackle the problems presented by a demand for modern, responsive, fault tolerant, and elastic systems. It is based on the material published in The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices book.",
