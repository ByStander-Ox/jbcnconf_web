In more recent years, even as a consequence of the advent of multicore CPUs, Functional Programming and its principles started attracting more interest, becoming at least equally relevant in our industry. The biggest mistake made by programmers nowadays is considering OOP and FP as two mutually exclusive paradigms. This misconception is also the product of a misunderstanding about what OOP actually means and its founding principles. The biggest pros of OOP are polymorphism and encapsulation while FP strengths are immutabilty and its declarative style, but these features are orthogonal and there's no reason why they cannot coexist in the same program. The final purpose of this talk is twofold: debunking the misconceptions on OOP and showing that OOP and FP are actually complementary techniques that can happily coexist in the same codebase. It is the duty of experienced developers to fill their toolbox with both OOP and FP tools and to know from time to time how to choose and employ the tool that is the best fit for the problem at hand.","type":"talk","tags":["Java","Functional Programming","Object Oriented Programming","Design pattern","Best practices"],"level":"middle","speakers":["16fd0826550372e61a8c17d3acdf30d0871de728"],"scheduleId":"#MON-TC1-SE6","video":"aRYIEoh5tPk"}

Let’s make fun of it then and perform some refactorings of code that identifies what poker figure given player holds. We will transform a set of nested if-else statements into a nice chain of responsibility classes (Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, ...) . This way the chain of classes put into sequential order will figure out the score given player holds. Proxy design patterns will come into the picture as well.\n\nAll I can promise during this refactoring workshop is definitely no bluffing - just pure focus on code transformations. BTW : Did you know that real poker players are bluffing very rarely…? \n\nPrerequisite : become acquainted with poker rules if you haven’t played it so far, as business perspective and understanding existing code is the initial step for any refactoring.

Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.\n\nSpring Framework 5 is here !

Running the application in production, however, is a whole other story. Production life is harsh, unforgivable and the ultimate verification whether your application is able to add value to its users. Besides knowing the Java Enterprise APIs, developers therefore also need to know how to meet production requirements.\n\nThis session shows which non-functional requirements we enterprise developers need to be aware of to build stable and resilient applications. We will see different resiliency approaches, such as circuit breakers, bulkheads, or backpressure, in action. We will implement these concepts using the Java Enterprise API, MicroProfile, and certain Java EE extensions. Furthermore, we will see, how especially service meshes enable us to add resiliency to multiple microservices in a transparent, redundancy-free fashion.\n\nAdding telemetry to our applications is crucial to gather insights about the application under production load. We will see how to enhance our microservices with concerns such as monitoring, tracing, or logging in a minimalistic way.\n\nAll of the time will be spent live-demoing Java Enterprise applications that are deployed to an Istio cluster.","type":"talk","tags":["Enterprise Java","Production Environments","Cloud Native Java"],"level":"middle","speakers":["1799a6d25dbe9b65e5a25078815b20fc9af956f4"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC2-SE5","video":"AEpRmnyE_K0"}

From DevTestOops to DevTestOps","abstract":"DevOps is growing in popularity in last years, particularly in (software) companies that want to reduce its lead time to be measured in days/weeks instead of months/years.\n\nIf you want that your software does the right things and the things right, you need to test it implacably.\n\nThe big problem is that companies see (and it is) testing phase as the bottleneck of the process slowing down product release. To change that, we need a new way of testing our applications, making the release process of an application a testing process as well and involve the QA since the beginning within the team. QAs are not a separate team anymore (DevTestOps).\n\nHow the testing pyramid is affected? In this session, we will not only describe but actively demonstrate several techniques that you can use immediately following the session for starting testing in production and speeding up your release cycle to unimaginable limits.","type":"talk","tags":["testing","devops","microservices"],"level":"beginner","speakers":["1cf43210c8515585e52e4d2f6f2e5e0f582049d8"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC5-SE3"}

Join this critical review of the major decisions taken in a typical enterprise application architecture and learn to balance pragmatism with your design goals. Find out how to do just-in-time design to keep as much use-cases as simple as possible.\n\n\nThe core purpose of this presentation is to learn to strike a **balance between pragmatism and maintainability** in your design. Without continuous refactoring, a simple design will inevitably degenerate into a Big Ball of Mud, under the assault of the new features and bugfixes. On the other hand, very highly-factored code can burden the take-off of the development and end up freezing the mindset in some rigid 'a-priori' design.\n\nThe end goal of this talk is to challenge you to rethink critically the architecture of your own systems, and seek ways to simplify it to match your actual needs, with a pragmatic mindset.\n\n\"Architecture is the art of postponing decisions\", said Uncle Bob. This talk takes this idea further and explains an optimal mindset about designing enterprise applications: Evolving (Continuously Refactoring) a Pragmatic (Simple), Clean (aka Onion) Architecture, aiming to provide Developer Safety™️ and Comfort™️. It’s the philosophy that Victor distilled over the past 5 years, designing and implementing 9 applications as IBM Lead Architect, and delivering trainings and advises to many other companies.\n\nYou’ll learn how to break data into pieces (Fit Entities, Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects), how to keep the logic simple (Facades, Domain Services, logic extraction patterns, Mappers, AOP), layering to enforce boundaries (keeping DTOs out of your logic, Dependency Inversion Principle), and many more, all in a dynamic, interactive and extremely entertaining session.\n","type":"talk","tags":["Clean Architecture","Pragmatic Design","Clean Code","Continuous Refactoring","Facade","Domain Service","Value Object","Emerging Architecture"],"level":"middle","speakers":["d27efdbbf9293c1d2cbcb35559c2558a0707a484"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC2-SE2","video":"WcU0EImGI_g"}

However enterprise demands often cause Spring Boot projects to become bloated, out of date, and have inconsistent implementations, leading to them being difficult to maintain both for the teams responsible for a project and from an enterprise level of ensuring projects properly implement features like security, logging, database connectivity, and other common concerns.  \n\nIn this presentation we will look at some of the underlying philosophies of Spring Boot and see at how to apply them to the enterprise. Specific topics include creating customs starter libraries, BOMs, and easing project initialization steps all with the goal of reducing developer toil and frustration while ensuring consistent behavior across large enterprises but not blocking experimentation.

Kotlin is probably the most popular one at this moment. Although Java is still one of the most commonly used programming languages, Kotlin seems to keep growing very fast. Where Java is known for its verbosity, Kotlin aims at making programming easier. On the other hand, Kotlin is a mix of paradigms and forces you to learn yet another language. Moreover, with all the new features that are rapidly introduced in Java, is Kotlin actually needed? So what are the aspects where they differ from each other? In which situations should we choose the one or the other?  Should we migrate to Kotlin or is Java good enough? As Kotlin claims full interoperability with Java, should we even choose?\nIn this talk we will fire up the battle between Kotlin and Java. In this battle one of us will root for Java while the other cheers for Kotlin. Who wins? That is totally up to you. The audience will be judge and jury.

But let’s face it, although Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world it isn’t the most popular language for writing functions—at least not yet. According to James Governor, “When Web Companies Grow Up They Turn into Java shops” so as functions become mainstream will Java become the dominant language for authoring functions? Can it be?\n\nIn this hands-on session, we will examine the challenges of using Java for Serverless functions and the latest features provided by the Java platform that address them. We will also dig into the open source Fn project’s unparalleled Java support (including Kotlin and Graal) which makes it possible to build, test, and scale out Java-based functions applications.","type":"talk","tags":["Serverless","FaaS","Docker"],"level":"middle","speakers":["a744f52d967ebb543100a1215f9fe38080a664f0"],"scheduleId":"#MON-TC2-SE6","video":"Q_41QgYpDrk"}

You’ll discover how the switch expressions (Java 12) make your code readable and concise, taking off the ambiguity with switch constructs. If you think using String concatenation is cumbersome, especially with regex, JSON, XML or SQL queries, don’t miss Raw String Literals (Java 13). That’s not all. Project Amber also includes Enhanced Enums, Data Classes, Lambda Leftovers, Pattern Matching, and Concise Method Bodies.\n\nHow do these additions or modification impact you to read or write code?

The problem is: designing distributed systems is not an easy task. The network is unreliable, services fail and there are lots of moving parts. At mytaxi, being able to resist partial failure is an essential requirement. We need to ensure that our customers have a smooth user experience, getting a taxi home or running into the airport, even when things go wrong in our system.<BR><BR>mytaxi's platform depends on ~250 services that might fail at any time. This talk is focused on how we achieve fault-tolerance and what we learned during this journey. I will discuss resilience techniques that we use and how they can be useful to your business as well.

It divides opinions at a company, department, and team level. Developers love arguing about their preferred programming language of choice. Debates and discussion often focus on what one language offers over another. No one ever talks about how to navigate this debate.\n\nIn this talk, I want to share how N26, the mobile bank the world loves to use, successfully overcame this debate by sharing the process of how we adopted Kotlin. I’ll share our failed attempts in other languages, why we decided to explore (yet another!) language, the process we went through and the heated discussions we had. I’ll highlight concrete experiments we conducted to collect data and share insights into our process of adopting a new programming language. I’ll also share some lessons learned about how it all went after a year of adopting Kotlin.\n\nThis talk will be highly elegant for those of you interested in Kotlin (or another language), considering how to adopt a new programming language, or how to influence others to adopt a new programming language.

Participants will get a chance to develop, test, deploy and debug contracts on a real blockchain testnet\n\nAt the end of the workshop attendees will understand how a blockchain works, understand the purpose of transactions and blocks and the role of contracts in the blockchain world.\n\nContracts are developed by implementing predefined interfaces. The contract code is deployed to the blockchain as a cloud data transaction, which stores the code itself, and a contract reference transaction which associates a specific account with an existing deployed contract and configures the contract setup parameters for this specific account.\n\nUnlike many other contract development frameworks, lightweight contracts are not executed by every node on the blockchain, instead node operators have to configure their node to run contracts by registering the contract runner addon. The contract runner monitors every new block for trigger transactions. When found it triggers the respective contract after loading it from the blockchain. The contract runner also supports contracts which execute on every block and provides APIs for triggering contracts directly or using a transaction voucher.\n\nWith this approach, the “contract” code itself is a simple Java class uploaded to the blockchain and therefore digitally signed and time stamped. However, the execution of the “contract” is only performed by nodes who selected to run the ‘ContractRunner’ addon.\n\nThe input to the contract is typically a transaction with an attached message, which identifies the contract to execute, and supplies optional parameters. The output of the contract are one or more transactions submitted to the network to update the blockchain state. The transactions submitted by the contract are normal transactions which have to comply with all the existing protocol rules.\nIn other words, the lightweight contract, is Java code which implements a certain interface, stored on the blockchain. The contract code is executed by anyone who wants to run it, not by every node, and is triggered by a blockchain transaction (or by each new block). The result of the calculation made by the contract is submitted as one or more normal transactions of any type supported by Ardor.","type":"workshop","requirements":{"link":"https://github.com/Jelurida/JBCNConf2019/blob/master/JBCNConf.2019.workshop.pdf"},"tags":["smart contracts","java","blockchain","ardor","ignis"],"level":"middle","speakers":["042bcb6c3a9fc6a76d300d96eb954ed04ec9847e","6db51a7a47f433795f5024926d64e6cff36ea6d1"],"scheduleId":"#WED-TC4-SE1"}

Think about it. We spend gigabytes of RAM for running Jenkins, Bamboo, Team City, or whichever tool we're using. And yet, those tools are often sitting idle inside our cluster, waiting to eventually receive a webhook notifying them that something should be done. As a result, resources are wasted when those tools are idle, and they are slow when under heavy load. If we add agents to the mix, we can quickly end up with hundreds of unused servers, and yet not have enough.\n\nWhat if we could run our tools only when we need them? What if we could scale them to any number of replicas to accommodate the increase in the number of builds, and scale them down to zero when there are no new commits? What if we can do all that with a single command? The answer to those and quite a few other questions is to go serverless with our continuous delivery tools. Jenkins X happens to do just that. It is a cloud-native Kubernetes-first solution that embraced a serverless model for managing our pipelines.","type":"talk","tags":["cloud","serverless","kubernetes","jenkins","continuous delivery"],"level":"middle","speakers":["0ba89c51baf9f8542188bd750973e0767fbcaa68"],"scheduleId":"#MON-TC2-SE5","video":"PEmsqzbiNFc"}

Some of those contributions have long reaching goals such as continued long-term maintenance, enhancements on language features like Project Valhalla and the value types support, and more.  Others have significant immediate effects on the runtime, like Shenandoah and Epsilon GC, the PPC64/S390 ports and the Native Memory Tracker.  In this presentation we will delve into the various features that are added by the Community of developers working on the Java platform, and we will introduce some ideas that while not yet part of any core project are being researched with the help of the OpenJDK Community, like Check Point Restore support. Finally we will discuss the Governance and the process to become an active contributor to move Java forward and share its future.","type":"talk","tags":["JVM langs","Cloud","design","Microservices"],"level":"beginner","speakers":["55fa365305bcd20ac6221f7f3123d50516ee9b35"],"scheduleId":"#MON-TC4-SE7"}

Developed by the creators of the Grails framework and with the support of many Spring developers, who have used their experience in these areas to develop a framework specifically focused on microservices.\n\nUnlike other frameworks, Micronaut does not analyze fields, methods and constructors at runtime by reflection, but already at compilation time, so that the start time and memory consumption of an application no longer depends on its size. Micronaut supports the declarative build of reactive HTTP clients that are implemented at compile time, further reducing memory consumption. Additional features such as non-blocking HTTP servers, easy execution of component tests with automatically started and managed test instances, dependency injection at compile time and the cloud-native approach can be implemented in a wondrously simple way.\n\nWith its relatively flat learning curve, Micronaut makes it as easy as possible to provide RESTful services. Of course, as usual today, also for distributed environments with integrated support of repeats in case of failure, circuit breakers and fallbacks for robust applications.\n\nOracle's newly developed GraalVM will change our view of microservices and cloud capabilities in the Java ecosystem and enable us to compete with native compilations. When Micronaut and GraalVM come together, both architectures can take full advantage of each other, resulting in amazingly efficient applications.\n\nIn my presentation I will give a rough overview and a short introduction to Micronaut on the GraalVM and show during a live coding session how to develop real microservices efficiently in a very short time.","type":"talk","tags":["Micronaut","GraalVM","Microservice","Java","Kotlin"],"level":"beginner","speakers":["034100c2dca6f7a15d06273390c11c6aa73949d3"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC3-SE7"}

We will see the evolution of a B2B integration solution from the first, rapid implementation and its uncontrolled growth in the form of a suite of monolithic applications. Finally, we will present an ongoing project to re-engineer the current suite of monoliths into an ecosystem of microservices based on Spring Boot and AWS. We will discuss our key technical decisions and their motivations and show how we are using design principles like DRY, KISS and YAGNI as well as other concept and tools from the DDD community to regularly deliver improved capability into production.","type":"talk","tags":["xp","design","microservices"],"level":"beginner","speakers":["3fc412c583929270737441ebc55548b143c26df2","7c41482d4a5c1489ef6a87492526f86dac649b7e"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC3-SE6"}
