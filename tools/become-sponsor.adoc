JBCNConf is the biggest Java & JVM conference in Spain, and has become the reference for Java developers in southern Europe with more than 740 attendees during the last edition.

*For the next edition during July 2020 we expect more than 800 attendees, from 6th to 8th of July in the 6th edition.*

And we feel JBCNConf is the right place to go if you are considering

    * _increasing IT branding of your organization_, 
    * _getting in touch with the best developers_,
    * _contacting technology leaders_ or just 
    * _improve your employee's training_ on the latest technologies.
