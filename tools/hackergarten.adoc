== This year we are running our first Hackergarten at JBCNConf!

The point is to *work on an Open Source of your choice* in order to fix a bug, create a feature, write a blog post, create a video, or anything else you might think of that can be a contribution to the chosen project.
*Also, if you ever wanted ot contribute to a project and don't know how*, we will help you.

We'll hack on anything as long as itâ€™s Open Source, no matter the programming language, platform, IDE, etc.
This will be a *welcoming open space regardless of your skill level*.
Whether you are an experienced developer, a junior developer or a student, you are more than welcome to join.
*We guarantee that you'll learn something* ðŸ˜„

== Schedule

We will have 2 sessions: 

* Monday 10:35 - 17:05
* Tuesday 10:35 - 16:55

You can *join at any time* during the sessions and *leave at any time*.
Besides learning from our great array of speakers that you have become accustomed to at JBCNConf, you can also learn from practical participation.
We'll keep a running tally of which projects are being worked one at any time.
